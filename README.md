# Contact Register
This project is a task I received working at Esi Brasil as a Trainee. 
This application is used to control the Contacts and User records, made using C# and EF Core, DataBase was used SQL Server. Now, let's see about the project:
<br />
<br />
1. To access the site, the user must be logged in to a session, 
if user forgot password, this can be recovered by option "Redefinir Senha/Reset Password". The new password is immediately sent to the user's e-mail.

<br />
<br />
<br />

2. On the contacts page, all records can be organized by six types of orders (id, name, cellphone, company name, state and registration date) as DataTable makes this feature available.
- On the same page you can choose the option to register a new contact, or edit/delete an existing contact.
- If you are adding a new contact, there are mandatory fields to fill in.

<br />

3. The users page also contains a DataTable, but it provides different types of lookups (Id, Name, Email, Profile, Register Date).
- The admin user has all access over the app's features, the standard user has all access except for the Users page control. <br />

<br />
<br />
<br />

- When you add a new user, there are also mandatory fields and you can choose the profile between these two options: Admin or Standard. <br />
